# üè† Homelab
Welcome to my homelab repository! This is where I document and manage the configuration of my personal homelab, built to explore Kubernetes and related technologies.

## Introduction
This repository contains the configuration, manifests, and documentation for my homelab, running on a single Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB) with K3s, a lightweight Kubernetes distribution.

I created this homelab to deepen my understanding of Kubernetes by:
- **Learning:** Experimenting with Kubernetes concepts like pods, deployments, services, and Ingress in a hands-on environment.
- **Trying new technologies:** Testing tools like K3s, container networking, and storage solutions on resource-constrained hardware.
- **Developing troubleshooting skills**: Gaining practical experience in debugging and managing a self-hosted Kubernetes cluster.
- **Hands-on practice:** Building real-world skills in orchestration, configuration management, and application deployment.

## üíª Hardware

### Node
- **Rasperry Pi 4 Model B (8GB RAM)**
    - CPU: Quad-core Cortex-A72 (ARM v8) 64-bit
    - OS: Rasberry Pi OS Lite 64-bit

The Pi is compact, energy-efficient, and perfect for a budget-friendly homelab, though it requires careful resource management for Kubernetes workloads.
